### Project Details

To make the frontend(client side) I have used React,which is a JavaScript Library. 
For styling I have used a combination of vanilla css and Material-Ui.

For backend (server side) used node and express as a framework.
And lastly for storing data I used mongodb which is a nosql database.

For Hosting I have used Netlify for the client side and Heroku for the server side codes.
